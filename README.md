# Basic Calculator Project :
# Overview
The Basic Calculator project is a simple console-based application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user provides two numerical inputs and selects an arithmetic operation, and the calculator returns the result. This project aims to demonstrate fundamental concepts of Java programming, including input handling, conditional logic, and basic arithmetic operations.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations efficiently and accurately. It also serves as a learning tool to understand the implementation of control structures, user input, and basic error handling in Java.

# Key Activities
✅User Input Handling: Prompting the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operator.
<br>
✅Operation Execution: Performing the selected arithmetic operation based on user input.
<br>
✅Result Display: Displaying the result of the operation in a clear and formatted manner.
<br>
✅Error Handling: Managing edge cases such as division by zero and invalid operator selection.
<br>

# Technologies Used
✅Java: The core programming language used for developing the application.
<br>
✅JDK: Java Development Kit, required to compile and run the Java program.
<br>
✅IDE: (Optional) Integrated Development Environment like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse can be used for writing and debugging the code.
<br>
✅Command Line/Terminal: Used to compile and execute the program.
