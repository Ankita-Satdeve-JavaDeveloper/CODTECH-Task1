# Basic Calculator Project :
# Overview
The Basic Calculator project is a simple console-based application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user provides two numerical inputs and selects an arithmetic operation, and the calculator returns the result. This project aims to demonstrate fundamental concepts of Java programming, including input handling, conditional logic, and basic arithmetic operations.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations efficiently and accurately. It also serves as a learning tool to understand the implementation of control structures, user input, and basic error handling in Java.

# Key Activities
âœ…User Input Handling: Prompting the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operator.
<br>
âœ…Operation Execution: Performing the selected arithmetic operation based on user input.
<br>
âœ…Result Display: Displaying the result of the operation in a clear and formatted manner.
<br>
âœ…Error Handling: Managing edge cases such as division by zero and invalid operator selection.
<br>

# Technologies Used
âœ…Java: The core programming language used for developing the application.
<br>
âœ…JDK: Java Development Kit, required to compile and run the Java program.
<br>
âœ…IDE: (Optional) Integrated Development Environment like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse can be used for writing and debugging the code.
<br>
âœ…Command Line/Terminal: Used to compile and execute the program.
<br>

ðŸŽ“ In the Basic Calculator project, several Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Java programming concepts are utilized. Below is a detailed explanation of these concepts:

2. Methods
Concept: Methods in Java are blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be called to execute the tasks when needed.
Usage: The main method is the entry point of the Java application. It contains the logic for handling user input, performing operations, and displaying results.
<br>
<br>
1. Class and Object
Concept: In Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. The class defines the attributes and behaviors that the objects will have.
Usage: The SimpleCalculator class serves as the blueprint for the application. It encapsulates all the methods and variables needed to perform the calculator's functions. Though the class does not create multiple objects in this case, it acts as the container for the main method and the logic.
<br>
<br>
3. Control Structures
Concept: Control structures dictate the flow of the program based on conditions.
Usage: The if-else control structure is used to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the operator input by the user. It also handles error checking, such as division by zero or invalid operator input.
<br>
<br>
4. Input Handling
Concept: Java provides mechanisms to receive input from the user, typically via the console or a graphical interface.
Usage: The Scanner class is used to capture user input from the console. It handles the input of numbers and the operator, ensuring that the program can interact with the user.
<br>
<br>
5. Arithmetic Operations
Concept: Java provides operators for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Usage: The calculator program uses these operators (+, -, *, /) to perform calculations based on user input.
<br>
<br>
6. Data Types
Concept: Java has various data types to store different kinds of values, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, etc.
Usage: The program uses the double data type to store numerical inputs and results, allowing it to handle both integer and floating-point numbers. The char and String types are used to handle the operator input.
<br>
<br>
7. Error Handling
Concept: Error handling in Java involves anticipating and managing potential errors that may arise during program execution.
Usage: The program includes error handling for division by zero and invalid operator input. It checks for these conditions and provides appropriate feedback to the user.
<br>
<br>
8. String Handling
Concept: Java provides classes and methods to manipulate and handle strings of text.
Usage: The program uses String to handle the operator input and compares it with valid operators using the equals() method.
<br>
<br>
9. Console Output
Concept: Java allows programs to output text and other information to the console.
Usage: The program uses System.out.print and System.out.printf to display prompts, error messages, and results to the user in a clear and formatted way.
<br>
<br>
10. Encapsulation (Conceptual)
Concept: Encapsulation is an OOP principle where the internal state of an object is hidden and can only be modified through methods.
Usage: Although this simple program doesnâ€™t fully implement encapsulation, the SimpleCalculator class conceptually encapsulates the logic and data within a single class, demonstrating the idea of grouping related functionality together.
