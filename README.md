    <h1>Basic Calculator Project</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Basic Calculator project is a simple console-based Java application that performs basic arithmetic operations. It allows users to input two numbers and an operator, then displays the result of the operation. This project is an exercise in fundamental Java programming concepts, including user input handling, conditional logic, and arithmetic operations.</p>

    <h2>Project Objective</h2>
    <p>The objective of this project is to develop a functional calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator ensures user-friendly interaction and provides accurate results, with error handling for invalid input and division by zero.</p>

    <h2>Key Activities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Implementing a simple user interface through the console for input and output.</li>
        <li>Reading user inputs for the first number, operator, and second number.</li>
        <li>Processing the inputs based on the selected operator to perform the appropriate arithmetic operation.</li>
        <li>Displaying the result of the operation to the user.</li>
        <li>Handling edge cases, such as invalid operators and division by zero, with appropriate error messages.</li>
        <li>Ensuring the program gracefully handles and exits after completing the operation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> Java</li>
        <li><strong>IDE:</strong> Any Java-compatible IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans</li>
        <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Git</li>
        <li><strong>Console I/O:</strong> Java's Scanner class for reading user input and printing output</li>
    </ul>
