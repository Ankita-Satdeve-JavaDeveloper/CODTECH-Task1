# Basic Calculator Project :
# Overview
The Basic Calculator project is a simple console-based application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user provides two numerical inputs and selects an arithmetic operation, and the calculator returns the result. This project aims to demonstrate fundamental concepts of Java programming, including input handling, conditional logic, and basic arithmetic operations.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations efficiently and accurately. It also serves as a learning tool to understand the implementation of control structures, user input, and basic error handling in Java.

# Key Activities
âœ…User Input Handling: Prompting the user to input two numbers and an arithmetic operator.
<br>
âœ…Operation Execution: Performing the selected arithmetic operation based on user input.
<br>
âœ…Result Display: Displaying the result of the operation in a clear and formatted manner.
<br>
âœ…Error Handling: Managing edge cases such as division by zero and invalid operator selection.
<br>

# Technologies Used
âœ…Java: The core programming language used for developing the application.
<br>
âœ…JDK: Java Development Kit, required to compile and run the Java program.
<br>
âœ…IDE: (Optional) Integrated Development Environment like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse can be used for writing and debugging the code.
<br>
âœ…Command Line/Terminal: Used to compile and execute the program.
<br>

ðŸŽ“In the Basic Calculator project, several Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Java programming concepts are utilized. Below is a detailed explanation of these concepts:
# Concepts:
âœ… Class and Object :
<br>
Concept: In Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. The class defines the attributes and behaviors that the objects will have.
<br>
Usage: The SimpleCalculator class serves as the blueprint for the application. It encapsulates all the methods and variables needed to perform the calculator's functions. Though the class does not create multiple objects in this case, it acts as the container for the main method and the logic.
<br>
âœ… Methods :
<br>
Concept: Methods in Java are blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be called to execute the tasks when needed.
<br>
Usage: The main method is the entry point of the Java application. It contains the logic for handling user input, performing operations, and displaying results.
